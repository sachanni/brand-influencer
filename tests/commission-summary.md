# Commission System Test Coverage

## Automated Test Cases Created

### 1. Commission Calculation Logic Tests
- ✅ **5% commission calculation** for standard payment amounts (₹10K, ₹50K, ₹100K)
- ✅ **Decimal amount handling** with precision validation
- ✅ **Payment type calculations**: Upfront (50%), Completion (50%), Full (100%)
- ✅ **Mathematical accuracy** for all commission scenarios

### 2. Edge Case Testing
- ✅ **Zero amount handling** - ensures no division by zero errors
- ✅ **Very small amounts** (₹0.01, ₹1, ₹10) with precise calculations
- ✅ **Very large amounts** (₹10 Lakh, ₹1 Crore) without overflow issues
- ✅ **Negative amounts** - graceful handling (rejected in real system)
- ✅ **Floating point precision** - JavaScript precision issue mitigation

### 3. Payment Processing Integration
- ✅ **Commission deduction** during upfront payment processing
- ✅ **Commission deduction** during completion payment processing
- ✅ **Financial transaction recording** with proper commission metadata
- ✅ **Error handling** for payment processing failures
- ✅ **Data consistency** between payment and commission records

### 4. Database Records Validation
- ✅ **Commission record structure** - all required fields present
- ✅ **Unique transaction ID generation** for each commission record
- ✅ **Database error handling** - graceful failure without breaking flow
- ✅ **Metadata integrity** - payment type and commission rate stored correctly

### 5. Commission Reporting and Retrieval
- ✅ **Summary calculation** - total commission aggregation
- ✅ **Commission breakdown by type** (upfront vs completion)
- ✅ **Empty data handling** - zero commission scenarios
- ✅ **Date range filtering** for reporting periods

### 6. Invoice Generation with Commission
- ✅ **PDF generation** with commission breakdown included
- ✅ **Amount calculations** - subtotal, commission, GST, final total
- ✅ **Invoice number generation** - unique identifier creation
- ✅ **Commission disclosure** in invoice documents

### 7. Integration Tests
- ✅ **Complete payment flow** - upfront + completion with commission tracking
- ✅ **Data consistency** across all payment and commission records
- ✅ **End-to-end validation** of 5% commission system

### 8. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- ✅ **Missing campaign data** - graceful error handling
- ✅ **Missing proposal data** - proper error responses
- ✅ **Commission recording failures** - payment continues despite commission errors
- ✅ **Commission rate consistency** - validates 5% rate across all calculations
